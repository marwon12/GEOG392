## Project - GEOG392
In this project we decided to focus on taking drone imagery of cotten fields and writing an algorithm to detect
herbicide damage. We did this with python code and the use of multiple libraries. Here is the result that were were able to come up with using the python code and the included multispectral imagery that we collected.
Everything highlited in red is what the program deemed as dead or dying cotten.
